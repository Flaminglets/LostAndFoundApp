- We worked on this [Lost and Found website application](https://github.com/Flaminglets/LostAndFoundApp) for our 2107 Adv Internet Programming course.

- In this project, we implemented **React Next.js, Typescript, Sass, Material UI, MongoDB, and Mongoose **

- The features of our application are: Login Authentication, Dashboard, Filling up a Form, Search Bar, Filter button, Print and Share button

   -  Login Authentication: The user won't have to make an account, and can use their Google or Facebook account instead. They don't have to worry about remembering another username or password when logging in to the website.
   -  Dashboard: The homepage will consist of the dashboard where registered or non-registered users can view the top latest cases of the day, they view contact information and details of the missing pet or person. Registered users can make posts, edit posts and update posts.
   -  Filling a up Form: Registered users can make posts in their accounts only they can edit, update or delete. The form consists of information about the missing pet or person that needs to filled out so that viewers can be able to find or spot the missing quicker.
   -  Search Bar: The feature self-explanatory, the users whether registered or non-registered can quickly look up missing pet or person with the search bar in the upper right corner. Just look up a specific keyword and the application will look it up for the user and they won't have to scroll around to look it up.
   -  Filter button: Wherein the users can only look up either pets or people for better searching.
   -  Print button: This feature can be found in the pop-up detail page. With a press of this button the user registered or non-registered has the option to print the post.
   -  Share button: This feature can also be found in the pop-up detail page. Users can share the posts with the url attached.

<h3 align="left">About the Project</h3>
<p align="justified">
   The concept of our project is to help others find what they've lost. We want make it more convenient and accessible to people to post online rather than going around      the neighborhoods posting "MISSING" papers on electrical posts. With this website application, they can now make a posting within the comforts of their home and with just a        click of their fingers.
   This website application is user friendly and straight forward. Users do not need to register to make an account, they can login with their active Google or Facebook account. Users do not to be registered to view the latest posts, they can just look up the website and be able to browse with having the hassle of signing-in. However, they won't be able to post, for that feature users would have to be logged in.

<h3 align="left">How to use our Lost and Found website application</h3>
<p align="justified">
   This application will not prompt the user to make an account, they can browse through the cases wthout logging in but if they want to post a missing pet or person they can login with their Google account. Once logged in, user will see the homepage where the most latest cases and previous cases are found. When they click the cases it will lead thwm to a pop-up detail page to view all the information of the missing pet or person. Users will also see the contact information of the person who posted so that when and if they spot the missing pet or person they have a way to connect. On the pop-up detail page, that it also where the print and share button are located. Users can print the post or share the to spread the news.
   To go back to the homepage, click the "Lost and Found" title. Once back to the homepage, on the upper right corner of the header beside the "New post" button, user can see a search bar. This feature allows the user to look up only specifics they want to find out or look up. On the left corner, right beside the "Lost and Found" title, there is a Pet | Person filter. User will be able to filter if they only want to view missing pets or missing persons.
   Time to fill up the form! As mentioned above, only logged in users will be able to make a post. Beside the search bar, is the "New Post" button. This feature is where the user will be able to make a post for their missing pet or person, information about the missing will be asked of in this section, all field will need to be filled up to proceed with the posting. User can also upload an image for more details to the viewers. The user will also be asked to fill up contact information about themselves so that viewers will be able to connect with them. Once the user clicks the submit button, the next screen will show all the field the filled up for verification and then they will be led to their profile. 
   In the profile page, the user will be able to view all posts they made. They can either edit and update their posts or they can delete it by clicking the "Found" button. Once the post is deleted it will no longer be on the page.
   See? Our website application is very easy to maneuver around. It is user-friendly and straight forward even non-tech savvy users will be able to use it.
