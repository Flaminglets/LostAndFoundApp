- We worked on this [Lost and Found website application](https://github.com/Flaminglets/LostAndFoundApp)

- In this project, we implemented **React Next.js, Typescript, Sass, Material UI, MongoDB, and Mongoose **

- The features of our application are: Login Authentication, Dashboard, Filling up a Form, Search Bar

   -  Login Authentication: The user won't have to make an account, and can use their Google or Facebook account instead. They don't have to worry about remembering another username or password when logging in to the website.
   -  Dashboard: The homepage will consist of the dashboard where registered or non-registered users can view the top latest cases of the day, they view contact information and details of the missing pet or person. Registered users can make posts, edit posts and update posts.
   -  Filling a up Form: Registered users can make posts in their accounts only they can edit, update or delete. The form consists of information about the missing pet or person that needs to filled out so that viewers can be able to find or spot the missing quicker.
   -  Search Bar: The feature self-explanatory, the users whether registered or non-registered can quickly look up missing pet or person with the search bar in the upper right corner. Just look up a specific keyword and the application will look it up for the user and they won't have to scroll around to look it up.
   -  Filter button: Wherein the users can only look up either pets or people for better searching.
   -  Print button: This feature can be found in the pop-up detail page. With a press of this button the user registered or non-registered has the option to print the post.
   -  Share button: This feature can also be found in the pop-up detail page. Users can share the posts with the url attached.

<h3 align="left">About the Project</h3>
<p align="justified">
   The concept of our project is to help others find what they've lost. We want make it more convenient and accessible to people to post online rather than going around      the neighborhoods posting "MISSING" papers on electrical posts. With this website application, they can now make a posting within the comforts of their home and with just a        click of their fingers.
